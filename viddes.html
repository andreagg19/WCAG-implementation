            Underpants figures out how to turn on the camcorder. 
            He twists the little screen around so he can see himself in it.  
            Framing himself waist-up, he takes a moment to gather his thoughts... then presses RECORD.

        <p class="vvdd2">UNDERPANTS MAN</p> 

        <p class="vvddp">
            My name is Walter Hartwell White.  
            I live at 308 Belmont Avenue, Ontario, California 91764. I am of sound mind. To all law enforcement entities, 
            this is not an admission of guilt. I’m speaking now to my family. 
        </p>

        <p class="vvdd2">(swallows hard) </p>

        <p class="vvddp">
            Skyler... you are... the love of my life.  I hope you know that.  
            Walter Junior. You’re my big man. I should have told you things, both of you. I should have said things.  
            But I love you both so much.  And our unborn child. And I just want you to know that these... 
            things you’re going to learn about me in the coming days.
            These things. I just want you to know that... no matter what it may look like... 
            I had all three of you in my heart. 
        </p>

        <p class="vvddp">
            The sirens are WAILING now, on top of us.  WALTER WHITE, the underpants man, turns off the camcorder.  
            He carefully sets it on a bare patch of ground by his feet.  
            Next to it he sets his wallet, lying open where it can be seen. 
        </p>

        <p class="vvdd2">CLOSE ON the wallet -- a photo ID card is visible. </p>
            
        <p class="vvddp">
            Walt’s smiling face is on it.  
            It identifies him as a teacher at J.P. Wynne High School, Ontario Unified School District. 
            Walt pulls the chrome pistol from the back of his waistband, aiming it across the tall weeds.  
            It glints hard in the sun. Flashing red LIGHT BARS speed into view, skimming the tops of the weeds.  
            Heading straight for us. Walt stands tall in his underpants, not flinching.  
            Off him, ready to shoot the first cop he sees...
